# Monitor Replication
An iPython Notebook to monitor replication between a source and a target CouchDB cluster

This script came mainly from Chris Snow (snowch). I just added some testing and polished it a little.

## How to use
* Edit the monitor_replicationSAMPLE.ipynb under "Configure your credentials here:"
* Remove "SAMPLE" from the filename
* Start a new terminal at your folder and use 'jupyter notebook' command
* Click on "monitor_replication.ipynb" and run trough the different scripts

## Hints
* You need to download "The IPython Notebook" easiest way is to install "Jupyter Notebook" (http://jupyter.org)
